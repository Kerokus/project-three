Deployed Personnel Accountablity System

ABOUT: 
Accountability and tracking of deployed personnel has long been a challenge, especially in those units with numerous small teams conducting simultaneous missions across an entire theater. The planning of missions is usually done in a combination of Outlook emails, spreadsheets, and powerpoint, with the actual tracking of personnel being conducted via a daily Personnel Status (PERSTAT) which is often just an excel spreadsheet sent via email and often containing errors. 
The intent of this application is to place both mission planning and personnel status into a single location in order to reduce both errors and the number of spreadsheets and powerpoints.
